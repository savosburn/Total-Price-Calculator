Working with multiple inputs and currency can introduce some tricky precision
 issues.

Create a simple self-checkout system. Prompt for the prices and quantities of
 three items. Calculate the subtotal of the items.
  Then calculate the tax using a tax rate of 5.5%.
   Print out the line items with the quantity and total, a
   nd then print out the subtotal, tax amount, and total.

Example Output
Enter the price of item 1: 25
Enter the quantity of item 1: 2
Enter the price of item 2: 10
Enter the quantity of item 2: 1
Enter the price of item 3: 4
Enter the quantity of item 3: 1
Subtotal: $64.00
Tax: $3.52
Total: $67.52

Constraints
Keep the input, processing, and output parts of your program separate.
Collect the input, then do the math operations and string building, and
then print out the output.
Be sure you explicitly convert input to numerical data before doing any
calculations.
